Project:
 - sort out Prettier config & VSCode

Logic:
 - make moves counter
 - restart(reload?) game on finish
 - randomize pairs number on start

Visuals:
 - show "It's a match" message
 - add moves counter
 - add game paused animation
 - add animation for:
  - card turn
  - cards deal
  - victory

Later:
 - allow to choose difficulty on start
 - more card faces
